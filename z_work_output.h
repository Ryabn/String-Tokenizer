/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented:
            Extensive testing
        -Implemented:
            Program acts as a string parser that uses a finite state machine to determine the
            type of string a token represents
        -Partly implemented:
            None
    Bugs:
        Program sometimes has errors when parsing one string as the entire buffer

    Reflections:
        The way the table is made is hard coded and doesn't support user created tables
